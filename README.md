# Booster
Booster is a productivity tool designed to make navigating your workflow smoother than ever before. Using its amazing nested-task structure, Booster allows you to structure your tasks in the most natural way. Our flagship feature, Collaborative Tasks, ensure that your and your peers are on the same page -- say goodbye to hand-editing local copies of the same spreadsheet. With Booster, everything lives in the Cloud, updating in realtime, on every device.

### Our Story
Booster began as a project under Northeastern's Oasis program, but the end goal of this idea is so much more than what we created in those six months. This new repository holds the <i>new</i> Booster codebase, which as of November 2024 is the one that still receives regular updates, patches, and security updates. If you want to contribute to our efforts of bringing efficient task management software to the hands of everyone around the world, join our efforts by contributing to this repo!

### Under the Hood
Booster is built with React, which allows for all the responsive and satisfying animations that make Booster feel so polished. Cloud data is stored securely with Firebase, and our service's website is hosted on Vercel.
